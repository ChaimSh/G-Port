Born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. I moved to Brooklyn, NY to study in University. Upon receiving a BA and Rabbinical Ordination I took a teaching position in ULY elementary school. 

I married and we moved to Chicago, IL to raise our beautiful family. Here, I took a managerial role and simultaneously completed a Web Development course through Flatiron School. Truly an amazing experience! 

I feel that within my experience I have gained high level skills that any employer would appreciate. These include: communication, organization, team work, leadership skills and much more.
